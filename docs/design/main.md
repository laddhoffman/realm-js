# Initial overview

This will be a web app, essentially.
Network components will be optional to start.

The entire available screen space will be used as a view screen to render the 3d environment.

Interface components may be superimposed on top of this in 2 dimensions.

Later, these may be rendered in 3 dimensions relative to the player's point of view.
